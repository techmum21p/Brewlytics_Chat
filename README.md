## 🔍 Key Findings from Analysis

### 1. Customer Demographics (Notebook 01)
- **Gender Distribution**: 57.2% male, 41.3% female, 1.4% other
- **Age Profile**: Middle-aged customers (40-65 years) form the core demographic
- **Income Distribution**: Middle-class customers ($50K-$75K) with multimodal patterns
- **Membership Growth**: Explosive growth in 2017 (6,500+ new members), indicating successful market penetration
- **Data Quality**: 12.8% of customers missing demographics (MNAR - Missing Not At Random)

### 2. Feature Engineering (Notebook 02)
- **Data Leakage Removal**: Critical step removing `offer_completed` and `offer_viewed` features
- **Final Feature Set**: 24 clean features available at prediction time
- **Encoding Strategy**: 
  - One-hot encoding for nominal variables (offer_type, gender)
  - Ordinal encoding for ordered variables (age_group, income_bracket, tenure_group)
- **Missing Value Handling**: Median imputation for 0.13% missing values
- **Scaling**: StandardScaler applied to 11 numerical features

### 3. Machine Learning Models (Notebook 03)
- **Best Model**: Random Forest (F1 = 0.8601, AUC-ROC = 0.9277)
- **Model Comparison**:
  - Logistic Regression: F1 = 0.8240 (baseline)
  - Decision Tree: F1 = 0.8263
  - Random Forest: F1 = 0.8601 (winner)
  - XGBoost: F1 = 0.8515
- **Key Insight**: Ensemble methods significantly outperform simple baselines

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction (Notebook 04)
- **PCA Analysis**: 8 components capture 90% variance with 67% feature reduction
- **Performance Trade-off**: Only 1.30% F1 drop for 67% fewer features
- **Recommendation**: Use 8-component PCA model for production (efficiency gains)
- **Feature Contributions**: 
  - PC1: Customer tenure (membership_year, duration_days)
  - PC2: Demographics (age, income)
  - PC3: Offer characteristics (duration, difficulty)

### 5. Model Explainability (Notebook 05)
- **SHAP Analysis**: Revealed actual feature importance and directional impacts
- **Top Features**:
  1. `offer_type_discount` (21.41% importance) - Strongest completion driver
  2. `duration` (14.16% importance) - Shorter duration = higher completion
  3. `difficulty` (9.27% importance) - Easier offers = higher completion
- **Key Insight**: Offer design matters more than customer demographics (52% vs 34% importance)

### 6. Customer Segmentation (Notebook 06)
- **Optimal Segments**: 5 distinct customer clusters identified
- **Segment Profiles**:
  1. **New Male Members** (30.8%): Age 52, $60K income, 0.7 years tenure, 44.6% completion
  2. **Affluent Female Members** (36.2%): Age 58, $72K income, 1.3 years tenure, 65.9% completion
  3. **Missing Demographics** (11.5%): Data quality issue, 15.7% completion
  4. **Small Engaged Segment** (1.2%): High engagement, 63.2% completion

## 🚀 Web Application & Docker Deployment

A production-ready Streamlit web application has been deployed to predict offer completion rates in real-time. The app is fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

### Web Application Features

- **File Upload Interface**: Upload CSV files with customer and offer data
- **Real-time Predictions**: Generate predictions using the trained Random Forest model
- **Interactive Dashboard**: View prediction statistics, probability distributions, and top customers
- **Download Results**: Export predictions, with completion probabilities and tailored marketing strategies to CSV
- **Dynamic Marketing Strategy Generator**: Generates personalized marketing strategies based on customer profile and % prediction
- **Containerized**: Fully Dockerized for consistent deployment

### Quick Start with Docker

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
cd brewlytics_app
docker-compose up
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

**Note:** The app requires the trained model and data files. Download them from the [Google Drive link](#-dataset-overview) above before running.

#### Using Docker Build & Run

```bash
cd brewlytics_app

# Build the image
docker build -t brewlytics-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 -v $(pwd)/../Cafe_Rewards_Offers:/app/Cafe_Rewards_Offers brewlytics-app
```

### Running Locally (without Docker)

```bash
cd brewlytics_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Access the app at `http://localhost:8501`

### Required CSV Format

Your uploaded CSV should contain these columns:

**Offer Details**: `received_time`, `difficulty`, `duration`, `offer_type`

**Marketing Channels**: `in_email`, `in_mobile`, `in_social`, `in_web`, `offer_received`

**Customer Demographics**: `age`, `income`, `gender`, `age_group`, `income_bracket`

**Membership Information**: `membership_year`, `membership_duration_days`, `membership_month`, `tenure_group`

**Flags**: `is_demographics_missing`

### Output

The app generates predictions with:
- `prediction` - Binary prediction (0: Will Not Complete, 1: Will Complete)
- `prediction_label` - Human-readable label
- `completion_probability` - Probability of completing (0-1)
- `non_completion_probability` - Probability of not completing (0-1)
