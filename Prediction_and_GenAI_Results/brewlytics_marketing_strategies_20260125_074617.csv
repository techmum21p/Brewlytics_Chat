•	**Reframe the Offer as an Exclusive Loyalty Benefit for Existing Customers:** Do not present this as a ""New Customer"" offer. Instead, leverage their 2+ years of tenure by framing the informational offer as a special update, an exclusive guide, or a proactive check-in designed specifically for loyal customers to ensure they are maximizing their existing benefits, discovering advanced features, or optimizing their usage for potential savings.

•	**Highlight Extreme Ease and Imminent, Tangible Value-Add:** Explicitly state the minimal time commitment and the immediate, practical benefit. Use phrases like ""Spend 2 minutes to learn X"" or ""A quick, 3-step guide to Y."" For a low-income customer, clearly articulate how the information will help them save time, optimize their budget, or get more value from their existing services (e.g., ""Discover how to unlock hidden savings,"" ""Get instant access to our top 5 tips for maximizing your current plan,"" or ""Understand new features designed to stretch your budget further"").

•	**Utilize a Personalized, High-Visibility Communication Channel with a Direct Hook:** Given the 0% completion rate, the current delivery method is likely ineffective. Send a concise, personalized message via SMS or a prominent in-app notification (rather than a generic email). The message should address the customer by name, acknowledge their tenure (""As a valued customer for 2+ years...""), briefly state the offer's ease and duration, and include a clear, single link to the informational content.

*   **Highlight immediate, tangible benefits directly addressing financial concerns:** Frame the informational offer as a ""quick win"" or ""smart hack"" that directly helps save money, time, or maximize value. For example, use headlines like ""Unlock Hidden Savings in 60 Seconds!"" or ""Your Secret Weapon for Smarter Spending!"" delivered via a push notification or in-app message, leading to an ultra-concise, easy-to-digest piece of information (e.g., a simple infographic, a 30-second video clip, or 3 bullet points).

*   **Position as essential ""pro-tips"" for new users:** Leverage their ""New Customer (NEW)"" status and 6-12 months tenure by presenting the information as crucial insights that other new customers wished they knew sooner. Send a personalized email or in-app message titled ""Congrats on 6 Months! Here's a Pro-Tip to Get Even More Value!"" or ""New Customer Guide: Don't Miss These [Company Feature] Benefits!"" The call to action should be a single tap to reveal the easily digestible, difficulty 0.0 content.

*   **Embed and gamify for ultra-low friction engagement:** Given the 0.0 difficulty and 0% completion, the issue is likely engagement or visibility. Integrate the informational content directly into a highly frequented customer touchpoint (e.g., a rotating banner on the app home screen, a segment within a transactional email, or a quick pop-up after login). Make it interactive, like a ""Did You Know?"" question with a Yes/No option to reveal the answer instantly, or a simple ""Tap to Reveal Your 3 Quick Tips!"" to reduce the perceived effort to absolute zero."

*   **Curate a small, select list of premium, complementary products eligible for the BOGO.** Present these options directly within the offer communication (e.g., ""Buy X, Get Y Free, or try Z Free!"") with clear visuals and direct links to purchase, minimizing browsing effort and aligning with their preference for curated, high-quality choices.
